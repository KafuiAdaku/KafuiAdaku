## 🌱 What I'm Learning

- **React(link-to-resources-if-applicable)**:  

    I'm currently working on a React project to enhance my skills in frontend development and 
    showcase my backend expertise through a user-friendly interface. As a software engineer 
    specializing in backend development, I realized the importance of creating intuitive user 
    interfaces to make my code accessible to regular users.

    Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my ability to design and develop end-to-end 
    solutions that not only deliver powerful backend functionalities but also provide a smooth 
    and engaging user experience. Ultimately, I seek to build a portfolio piece that showcases 
    my proficiency in both backend and frontend development, highlighting my versatility 
    and dedication to delivering impactful software solutions.

## 💬 Ask Me About

- Backend Development:
I have a strong background in backend development, with experience in designing and building 
scalable APIs, database management, and optimizing server-side performance. Whether you're 
curious about RESTful architecture, database design principles, or performance tuning strategies, 
feel free to ask me anything related to backend development!

- React and Frontend Development:
While I'm currently expanding my frontend skills with React, I'm enthusiastic about 
creating engaging user interfaces and crafting seamless user experiences. 
If you're interested in React best practices, state management with Redux, 
or responsive design techniques, I'd love to share insights and discuss frontend development with you.
